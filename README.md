# Ginsburg_Hebrew_Bible_w_rafe

This is the final edition of the text which is ready for typesetting and printing. In his original 1894 edition, Ginsburg included the rafe mark, which indicates that a consonant is not pointed with the hardening dagesh. Most of the ancient Hebrew manuscripts use this point.
